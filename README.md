# Zed80
## Summary

Zed80 is a pure perl implementation of a z80 disassembler. It is based around
the algorithm described by Cristian Dinu called [Decoding Z80 Opcodes](http://www.z80.info/decoding.htm).
For the curious *Zed* stands for *Z80 Experimental Disassembler*. Zed80 is a
very simple disassembler that provides little more than an assembly dump of the
specified file.

## Usage

`./zed80.pl <file>`

The file be diassembled to standard output.
